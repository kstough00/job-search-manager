        About- Special 'Thanks' to COVID-19 for making this website possible; I
        was inspired by my current 'Unemployment' status and upcoming Job Search
        curriculum track so that I will finally be able to re-enter the
        workforce and regain some sense of normalcy. I am beyond excited!
